# Archived

I replaced this next.js site with an entire rewrite (and a site with an
entirely different purpose) at this same domain. This repository is frozen
but kept visible as a part of my portfolio.

# Technologies Used

as a very simple backend for receiving form responses and providing an admin
interface where I can view form submissions.
